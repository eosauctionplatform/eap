# EOS AUCTION PLATFORM

EAP = EOS AUCTION PLATFORM = Name of our Project = Also use our token symbol

The EAP software introduces a new blockchain platform designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across the platorm. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that may ultimately scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment and maintenance of decentralized applications, in the context of a governed blockchain
